## Background

Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked that you help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

An evaluation of several machine learning models to compare and find the better suited ones.

### Ensemble Learning

1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

    Both had the same exact score.
    
2. Which model had the best recall score?

    Balanced Random Forest Classifier

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

    Balanced Random Forest Classifier

4. What are the top three features?

    total_rec_prncp, total_pymnt and total_pymnt_inv 
    
### Credit Risk Resampling Techniques
1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

    Both Combination, UNDERSAMPLING and SMOTE scored better than Oversampling in a tie

2. Which model had the best recall score?

    All models scored the same.

3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

    Same, they tied.
